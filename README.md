ConnectO provides a platform to support amateur artists, online small business and content creators to showcase their talents, sell their art and craft and make a small profit out of it by letting the audience make generous contributions towards them.

## Case-Study

[Case Study to Understand what users want](https://venngage.net/ps/INFrzHevS8/connecto-case-study)

## Why This ?

The reason why we chose this problem as our project is because 	most of the social media artists have a hard time creating content and not getting enough response and benefits as they expect. This could demotivate them into discontinuing what they are good at. Some amateur artists who have a difficult time finding a stable job might want at least some income in their life to sustain them.
Hence, we came with the solutionâ€¦that is ConnectO. ConnectO is that platform which serves the purpose. In ConnectO you can let your fans become active participants in the work they love by offering them a monthly membership. You give them access to exclusive content, community, and insight into your creative process. In exchange, you get the freedom to do your best work, and the stability you need to build an independent creative career.
Now coming to the tools, we have used figma for designing, flutter for creating the app, to conduct a survey we used google forms, canva for presentation, and venngage for the case study.
From the survey conducted by us we came to the conclusion that 64.3% has a social media handle for displaying their artistic talents but 71.4% are dissatisfied with the amount of exposure they get.
Therefore we asked whether they would want an app like Connecto and astoundingly more than half of them are very much into the idea.
Here we have the statistics of how much the artist and the supporters would like to interact with each other.
Ultimately, 78.6% would like to showcase and sell their artwork as well as buy them and also interact with their supporters. 

Through this app of ours we hope to reach out to those undervalued artists out there who can have a source of income which will allow them to stand on their own feet and be proud of the talent they have. We wish ConnectO provides the support that an emerging youth needs to explore and navigate their life's focus on.
